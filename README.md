üåø Stillness Grove ‚Äì Game Design Document

üåü Core Concept

A relaxing, therapeutic game where players gently shape a living floating island through rhythm, breath, and minimal interactions. The goal is not to win, but to enter a state of calm focus and flow.

üß† Core Principles

Low cognitive load: no timers, combos, or high-speed input

Simple interactions: drag, click, float, breathe

Rhythmic feedback: visuals, music, and breathing in sync

Beautiful repetition: actions loop and evolve, not escalate

Micro-control: small nudges give satisfying, aesthetic reactions

Therapeutic UX: feels like meditating with your hands

üåø Game Features

Floating Island World

Soft, painterly 2D or 2.5D landscape with trees, rivers, clouds, fog

Breathing Overlay (Box Breathing Pulse)

A semi-transparent visual overlay that subtly pulses to guide 4-4-4-4 breathing

Ripple Interactions

Click or tap to send out ripples in water or air‚Äîresponsive but calming

Environmental Tuning

Drag clouds ‚Üí they merge and rain

Tap trees ‚Üí play soft notes

Shape wind, adjust light, grow plants

Dynamic Ambient Music

Music builds as you interact

Loops evolve, matching mood and actions

Could sync with breath mic input if enabled

Slow Evolution

Every login slightly changes the world

More birds, flowers, colors‚Äîbut always subtle

Sound Garden / Glow Pond Minigames

Optional micro-zones with simple, musical or visual play

Drop stones into a glowing pond and watch fish swim to the rhythm

Subtle, User-Driven Unlockables

Unlockables fade in gently; no popups, no fireworks

New plants, pets, backgrounds arrive with slow, ambient animations

Naming, moving, or tending unlocks happens in-world, not via notification

Unlocks often appear after reflection, not just action

Integration With Work Platforms (Optional)

Completing tasks (e.g. jobs in FixNow) can unlock subtle new grove elements

Rewards reinforce restorative cycles, not grind

Journaling and meditation can also trigger world evolution

üî¨ Scientific/Design Foundation

Entrainment: visual/audio rhythm syncing with player physiology

Box Breathing: scientifically backed breathing pattern for calming nervous system

Flow State Psychology: gentle challenge + high feedback = meditative focus

Biofeedback Potential: future add-on‚Äîconnect microphone or device sensors

Low-Stimulation Reward System: Unlockables designed as whispers, not shouts (see chat for full UX principles)

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Browser MVP & Full-Stack)

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for canvas-based rendering and breathing overlay

Canvas API: for animated island and ripple effects

AudioContext/Web Audio API: for interactive ambient sounds

Backend (for journaling, unlockables, and user sync): Django + SQLite/PostgreSQL

Data Flow: All unlocks, journals, and garden state stored in SQL via Django ORM

AJAX/REST: Use Django REST Framework or AJAX for async feature unlocks and journal saves

Optional: Firebase or localStorage for extra persistence if offline

üé® Aesthetic

Pastel tones, soft motion, hand-drawn style

Lo-fi Ghibli vibes

UI is minimal or hidden‚Äînothing breaks immersion

Subtle animations, no overstimulation; everything blends

üßòÔ∏è Player Outcome

After a session, player feels:

Mentally clearer

More present

Emotionally balanced

Like they‚Äôve played with peace, not escaped from stress

Grove feels more alive, not just "more stuff unlocked"

üìì Journal System Integration

Form to create new preset (define prompts/questions)

Journal entry form dynamically rendered from selected preset

2. Custom Journal Presets
